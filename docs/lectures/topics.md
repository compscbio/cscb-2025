# Lectures

The topics that we cover can be broadly split into three categories: stem cell biology, single cell data generation platforms, and computational methods for analyses of these data.

### (Stem) cell biology
We will cover some basic cell biology and then discuss the main areas of focus in stem cell biology.

- Stem cell biology basics
- Cell identity
- Development and differentiation
- Cell fate engineering
- Gene regulatory networks
- Cell-to-cell communication
- Controversies

### Single cell data generation platforms
The course will mainly use scRNA-seq data but we will also discuss other data modalities.

- Single cell RNA-seq
- Single cell ATAC-seq
- Spatial transcriptomics
- Lineage tracing

### Computational methods
In addition to the basic standard analysis pipelines, we will also cover more advanced methods.

- Integration and cell typing
- Trajectory inference
- Fate potential
- Forecasting and simulations
